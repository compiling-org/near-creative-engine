# Bitte Protocol AI-Enhanced Biometric Authentication Engine Grant Application

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: AI-Enhanced Biometric Authentication Engine with Bitte AI Agents
**Grant Amount Requested**: $50,000
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks pre-work done + 3-4 months grant work + post-work to maintain repos after grant period is over
**Team Size**: 2 developers (Dr. Kapil Bambardekar, Grigori Korotkikh)

## Executive Summary

We propose developing an AI-enhanced biometric authentication engine that leverages Bitte Protocol's AI agent infrastructure with REAL TensorFlow.js neural networks, Candle framework, and privacy-preserving biometric processing. This creates secure biometric authentication that processes emotion detection, valence/arousal/dominance analysis, and cross-chain AI inference - not basic gesture recognition.

**AI-POWERED BIOMETRICS + CROSS-CHAIN INFERENCE**: We have working AI implementation with TensorFlow.js emotion detection, Candle framework neural networks, WebGPU-accelerated AI processing, AND cross-chain AI bridge for biometric authentication across NEAR, Solana, Filecoin, Polkadot. Users authenticate through AI-analyzed biometric data with privacy-preserving hashing, then access cross-chain DeFi through Bitte's AI agent infrastructure.
